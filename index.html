Super Bowl Squares game for charity. Sell squares for $5 a pop. need to be able to allow each person to pick random squares (the numbers for squares wont be determined until gameday when randomly generated). half to charity which should be a big selling point,. Rocky Mountain MS Society. it should show total due for number of squares picked. show @Christian-Wallis1 venmo for who to pay in the header. it should resemble a 10 x 10 grid. Once a person has selected squares it should no longer allow that square to be available for others to pick.

Creating a Super Bowl Squares charity game with persistent storage, 10x10 grid, and charity donation tracking
super-bowl-squares.jsx

Presented file
I've created a Super Bowl Squares charity game! Here's what it includes:

Features:

10x10 interactive grid — click squares to select them, hover effects for available squares
Persistent storage — squares stay claimed across sessions so others can't pick them
Clear charity messaging — prominently displays Rocky Mountain MS Society and the 50% charity donation
Venmo info — @Christian-Wallis1 shown in the header for easy payment
Live totals — shows how many squares selected and total amount due
Running tally — displays total raised for charity so far
Random numbers note — indicates numbers will be assigned on Game Day
Confirmation modal — shows purchase details and payment reminder after claiming squares
Taken squares — display the owner's name and can't be re-selected
The grid uses "?" placeholders for the row/column numbers since those will be randomly generated on game day. Each square is $5, and the interface makes the charity angle a big selling point with the amount going to MS Society highlighted throughout.

ditch the heart. supporting Rocky Mountain MS Center. how about i have to approve the squares which will be confirmed once i see venmo payment. so I am the one who goes in and confirms. how should this work

10:54 AM
Good thinking! Let me create an admin flow where you can approve squares after confirming Venmo payment. I'll set up:

Public view - People claim squares (marks them as "pending")
Admin view - You see pending requests and approve/reject them after checking Venmo

2 steps

Creating Super Bowl Squares with admin approval workflow - pending/approved states, admin panel for confirming payments
super-bowl-squares.jsx

Presented file
Here's the updated Super Bowl Squares with admin approval!

How it works:

For participants:

Select squares on the grid
Enter their name and submit request
Squares turn yellow (pending) until you approve
They get instructions to pay via Venmo
For you (admin):

Click the small "Admin" link below the header
Password: mscharitybowl2025 (you can change this in the code on line 6)
See all pending requests with name, # of squares, and amount due
Approve once you see the Venmo payment → squares turn gray (confirmed)
Reject if payment doesn't come through → squares become available again
Legend on the grid:

Empty squares = Available
Yellow = Pending approval
Gray = Confirmed/Paid
The charity is now "Rocky Mountain MS Center" with no heart emoji. Let me know if you want to tweak the password or anything else!

$10 per square. assuming half to winner half to MS what are payouts.

11:00 AM
With $10 per square and 100 squares, here's how the money breaks down:

Total Pot: $1,000

$500 to Rocky Mountain MS Center
$500 to Winners
Typical Payout Structure:

Payout	When	Amount
1st Quarter	End of Q1	$100
Halftime	End of Q2	$100
3rd Quarter	End of Q3	$100
Final Score	End of Game	$200
This gives 4 chances to win, with the biggest prize at the end.

Want me to update the app to $10/square and add a payout breakdown section so people can see what they're playing for?

now, on gameday february 8th will the values of each box automatically populate?

11:04 AM
No, they won't automatically populate — you'll need to trigger the random number assignment yourself on game day.

Want me to add a feature for that? Here's what I'm thinking:

Admin-only "Generate Numbers" button that:

Only appears when you're logged in as admin
Randomly assigns 0-9 to each row and column (shuffled, no repeats)
Saves the numbers so everyone sees them
Can only be done once (with a confirmation prompt to prevent accidents)
Once generated, the "?" placeholders would turn into the actual numbers (0-9) on both the rows and columns.

Want me to add this?

yes exactly

Done! Here's how it works on game day:

As Admin:

Log in with the password
You'll see a purple "🎲 GENERATE GAME DAY NUMBERS" button
Click it → confirmation popup warns "This cannot be undone!"
Confirm → numbers 0-9 are randomly shuffled and assigned to rows/columns
The button disappears and shows "✓ Numbers have been generated!"
For everyone:

Before: All rows/columns show "?"
After: Actual numbers (0-9) appear on the grid
The note changes from "Numbers will be randomly assigned on Game Day" to "Numbers have been randomly assigned!"
The numbers are saved permanently, so once generated, everyone will see them.

so they have to sign up or sign in to use this public URL? are there other ways to do this. want it to be as simple as possible.

11:13 AM
Great point — right now it uses shared persistent storage which requires users to be signed into Claude. That's not ideal for a public link you want to share widely.

Here are simpler alternatives:

Option 1: Google Sheets Backend (Recommended)

You create a Google Sheet as the "database"
Share the sheet publicly (view) and use a Google Form for submissions
You manage everything in the spreadsheet
No sign-in needed for participants
Option 2: Simple Static Version

I create a clean HTML page you can host anywhere (GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
Participants see the grid and fill out a simple form with their name + square picks
Form submissions go to your email or a Google Form
You manually update the grid by editing the HTML (or I give you an easy way to do it)
Option 3: Airtable/Notion Backend

Free tier of Airtable as database
Embeddable form for submissions
You approve in Airtable, grid updates automatically
My recommendation: Option 1 (Google Sheets) — it's free, familiar, and you can easily see/manage everything. Participants just click a link, no sign-in required.

Want me to build that version?

so if i set up the backend once something gets submitted it will update on the link correct

11:14 AM
Yes, exactly! Here's how it would work:

Setup (one time):

You create a Google Sheet (I'll give you the template)
You connect a Google Form for submissions
You deploy the page (I can give you a simple HTML file to host on GitHub Pages for free)
How it flows:

Participant clicks your link
       ↓
Sees the grid (pulls data from your Google Sheet)
       ↓
Picks squares, enters name, submits
       ↓
Goes to "Pending" in your Google Sheet
       ↓
You see Venmo payment come in
       ↓
You change status from "Pending" → "Confirmed" in the sheet
       ↓
Grid automatically updates for everyone
The catch: Google Sheets API requires an API key for reading data publicly, which adds a small setup step.

Even simpler alternative: I could use a free service like JSONBin or SheetDB that wraps Google Sheets — less setup, same result.

Want me to build it with one of these approaches? I'd just need to know:

Are you comfortable with a tiny bit of Google Cloud setup (free), or want the absolute simplest path?
is the google cloud setup something only i would deal with? or would every user need to

11:15 AM
Only you, one time. Participants would just see a simple webpage — no setup, no sign-in, nothing.

What participants experience:

Click your link
See the grid
Pick squares, enter name, submit
Get told to Venmo you
Done
What you do once:

Create a Google Sheet
Get an API key from Google Cloud (free, takes ~5 min)
Paste the API key into the code I give you
Host the HTML file (I can walk you through GitHub Pages — also free)
After that, you just manage everything from your Google Sheet. Approve squares, generate numbers, enter final score — all from the spreadsheet.

Want me to build it this way?

yeah i have google cloud storage and gmail already

11:15 AM
Perfect, that makes it even easier. Let me build this out for you.

I'll create:

HTML file - the public-facing page (no sign-in needed for anyone)
Google Sheet template - structure for managing squares, pending requests, numbers, and final score
Setup instructions - how to get your API key and connect everything
Give me a few minutes to put this together.


1 step

Creating setup instructions document
SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md

Presented 2 files
Done! I've created two files:

1. squares-for-heidi.html - The public webpage

No sign-in required for participants
Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
You just update a Google Sheet to manage everything
2. SETUP-INSTRUCTIONS.md - Step-by-step guide

The flow:

Participant visits your link
    ↓
Picks squares, enters name, submits
    ↓
Shows up in your Google Sheet (Form Responses)
    ↓
You see Venmo payment
    ↓
You move them from "Pending" to "Squares" tab
    ↓
Grid updates automatically for everyone
You manage everything from Google Sheets:

Approve squares → add to "Squares" sheet
Generate numbers → paste shuffled 0-9 in "Settings"
Enter final score → type Chiefs,31,Eagles,28 in "Settings"
The one-time setup takes about 15-20 minutes. Want me to walk you through any part of it?

im getting errors

11:19 AM
What errors are you seeing? Can you share:

What the error message says
Where you're seeing it (on the webpage, in Google Cloud, etc.)
What step you're on in the setup
A screenshot would help too if you can paste one here.

1769192369473_image.png
11:19 AM
Ah, I see - "Failed to fetch" means it can't connect to Google Sheets yet. This is happening because the CONFIG values in the HTML file still have the placeholder text.

Have you completed these steps yet?

Created the Google Sheet with the 3 tabs (Squares, Pending, Settings)?
Got your API key from Google Cloud Console?
Updated the CONFIG in the HTML file with your actual values?
If you haven't done the setup yet, the error is expected - the page is trying to fetch from YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID_HERE which doesn't exist.

Quick check - open the HTML file and look for this section near the bottom:

javascript
const CONFIG = {
  SHEET_ID: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_SHEET_ID_HERE',  // ← Did you replace this?
  API_KEY: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_API_KEY_HERE',     // ← And this?
  ...
If the setup feels like too much, I can simplify this even further - I could make a version that:

Uses a simple embedded Google Form for submissions
You just manage a Google Sheet manually
No API key needed at all
The tradeoff is the grid won't auto-update (you'd need to manually update the HTML when squares are claimed). Would that be easier for you?

which credentials for api key

11:28 AM
The API Key option isn't showing in your dropdown. You need to scroll up in that menu - there should be an "API key" option above "OAuth client ID".

If you don't see it, try this instead:

Close that dropdown
Look on the left sidebar for "APIs & Services"
Click "Enabled APIs & services"
Search for "Google Sheets API" and make sure it's enabled
Then go back to Credentials and try "+ Create credentials" again
The full menu should show:

API key ← This is what you want
OAuth client ID
Service account
Help me choose
Can you scroll up in that dropdown and see if "API key" is there?

1769193230465_image.png
what from here? where is api key

11:33 AM
This is the wizard view. Let's get out of this and go directly to API key creation:

Click "Cancel" at the bottom
Go back to the Credentials page (click "Credentials" in the left sidebar)
At the top of the page, look for "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" button
This time, look more carefully at the dropdown - "API key" should be the first option at the very top of the menu
If you still don't see "API key" as an option, it might be because the Google Sheets API isn't enabled yet:

Click "Library" in the left sidebar
Search for "Google Sheets API"
Click on it and hit "Enable"
Then go back to Credentials → + CREATE CREDENTIALS → API key
Let me know what you see!

are app restrictions really necessary? all payments will be made via venmo anyways

11:35 AM
You're right - for this use case, app restrictions aren't necessary. The API key only allows reading your public Google Sheet. There's no payment info, no sensitive data.

Worst case if someone got your key? They could... read your Super Bowl squares grid. Not a big deal.

Just skip the restrictions:

Create the API key
Copy it
Paste it into the HTML file
Done
You can always add restrictions later if you want, but for a charity fundraiser game it's really not needed. Keep it simple!

Did you get the API key created?

Here's what you need to do next:

You have the API key ✓ — Now:
Step 1: Create the Google Sheet "Squares for MS"
Create 3 tabs at the bottom:

Tab 1: "Squares" (header row only to start)

Row	Col	Name
Tab 2: "Pending" (header row only to start)

Row	Col	Name
Tab 3: "Settings"

Key	Value
RowNumbers	
ColNumbers	
FinalScore	
Step 2: Make the Sheet Public
Click Share (top right)
Click "Anyone with the link" → set to Viewer
Copy the URL — grab the Sheet ID from it:
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/THIS_PART_IS_YOUR_SHEET_ID/edit
Step 3: Create a Google Form
Go to forms.google.com
Create form with 2 questions:
"Name" (short answer)
"Squares" (short answer)
Click ⋮ → Get pre-filled link → fill dummy values → Get link
From that URL, grab:
Form URL (change viewform to formResponse)
Entry IDs (entry.XXXXXXX)
Step 4: Update the HTML
Open squares-for-ms.html, find the CONFIG section, and paste your values:

javascript
const CONFIG = {
  SHEET_ID: 'your-sheet-id-here',
  API_KEY: 'your-api-key-here',
  FORM_URL: 'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/.../formResponse',
  FORM_FIELDS: {
    name: 'entry.XXXXXX',
    squares: 'entry.XXXXXX'
  }
};
What step are you on? I can help with any part.

google forms has 3 dots then "Pre-fill form' is that what im looking for

11:46 AM
Yes, that's it! Click "Pre-fill form".

Then:

Type anything in the Name field (like "test")
Type anything in the Squares field (like "test")
Click "Get link" at the bottom
Copy that link
The link will look something like:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf.../viewform?usp=pp_url&entry.123456789=test&entry.987654321=test
From that link you need:

Form URL: Change viewform to formResponse at the end
Entry IDs: The entry.123456789 and entry.987654321 parts
Share the link with me when you get it and I can help you pull out the right pieces!

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1L6UXIX3TF182DnQHlNDBzfbsiabsyFp0M1Ba9JYqIok/prefill this link?

11:47 AM
Almost! That's the edit link, not the pre-filled link.

After you clicked "Pre-fill form" and typed in test values:

Look for a "Get link" button (usually bottom left)
Click it
It should give you a much longer URL with entry.XXXXXXX=test in it
Can you try clicking "Get link" after filling in the test values? The URL you need will have those entry. numbers in it.

11:47 AM
That's it! Now I can pull out what you need:

Form URL (change viewform to formResponse):

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2PRzoEIaCLal5TGvhmmxj4HsTJ56um6SvJzUaJyAnTEuvuQ/formResponse
Entry IDs:

Name: entry.338392548
Squares: entry.2075961659
Now open your squares-for-ms.html file and update the CONFIG section with:

javascript
const CONFIG = {
  SHEET_ID: 'YOUR_SHEET_ID_HERE',
  API_KEY: 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE',
  FORM_URL: 'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2PRzoEIaCLal5TGvhmmxj4HsTJ56um6SvJzUaJyAnTEuvuQ/formResponse',
  FORM_FIELDS: {
    name: 'entry.338392548',
    squares: 'entry.2075961659'
  }
};
You still need to paste in:

Your Sheet ID (from your Google Sheet URL)
Your API Key (the one you just created)
Can you share your Google Sheet URL so I can grab the Sheet ID for you?

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_aiLESCaL17Cq7OMSJGwV8ectthzy7YDk0fHijZioi0/edit?gid=437392468#gid=437392468

11:49 AM
Got it! Your Sheet ID is:

1_aiLESCaL17Cq7OMSJGwV8ectthzy7YDk0fHijZioi0
Now just need your API Key (the one you created in Google Cloud Console - starts with AIza...)

Once you share that, I'll update the HTML file with all your values so it's ready to go.

1769194192473_image.png
wait is this right

11:49 AM
Yes! Click "Link to Sheets" — that green Sheets icon.

Then choose "Select existing spreadsheet" and pick your "Squares for MS" sheet.

This will send all form submissions to your spreadsheet automatically, so when someone requests squares, you'll see it right there.

After you do that, share your API key and I'll update the HTML file with all your values.

✅ Sheet ID
✅ API Key
✅ Form URL

Before it will work, make sure your Google Sheet has:

3 tabs named exactly:
Squares

Each tab needs headers in Row 1:
Squares tab: Row | Col | Name
Pending tab: Row | Col | Name
Settings tab: Key | Value
Settings tab needs these rows:
Key	Value
RowNumbers	
ColNumbers	
FinalScore	
Sheet must be shared as "Anyone with link can view"
Once that's set up, try opening the HTML file — it should load without errors!

11:52 AM
Close! I see you have the tabs, but they need to be set up correctly:

Form Responses 1 - ✅ This is fine (auto-created by the form)

Squares tab - needs headers:

Click on the "Squares" tab
In Row 1, type: Row in A1, Col in B1, Name in C1
Pending tab - needs headers:

Click on the "Pending" tab
In Row 1, type: Row in A1, Col in B1, Name in C1
Settings tab - needs this exact setup:

Click on the "Settings" tab
Row 1: Key in A1, Value in B1
Row 2: RowNumbers in A2, leave B2 empty
Row 3: ColNumbers in A3, leave B3 empty
Row 4: FinalScore in A4, leave B4 empty
Also make sure the sheet is shared:

Click Share (top right)
Change to "Anyone with the link"
Set to "Viewer"
Try again after that — the "Failed to fetch" is likely because the sheet isn't public yet or the tab names/headers don't match exactly.

i did that. error fetch

11:54 AM
Let's check a few things:

1. Is the sheet shared publicly?

Click Share → "Anyone with the link" → "Viewer"
2. Are the tab names exactly right? (case sensitive)

Squares (not "squares" or "SQUARES")
Pending
Settings
3. Let me test your API key directly. Open this URL in your browser:

What do you see? Either:

JSON data = API is working, issue is something else
Error message = tells us what's wrong (API not enabled, sheet not public, etc.)
Paste what you see and I'll know exactly what to fix!

Found it! You have a typo:

FInalScore → should be FinalScore

(Capital "I" instead of lowercase "i")

Go to your Settings tab and fix that cell to say FinalScore exactly.

But actually, that alone shouldn't cause the fetch error. Let me also check — can you try this URL to test the Squares tab:

And this one for Pending:

The API is working fine. The issue is that you're viewing the HTML file in Claude's artifact preview, which blocks external requests.

To test it properly:

Download the squares-for-ms.html file
Open it directly in your browser (double-click the file, or drag it into Chrome/Firefox)
It should work when opened as a local file. Try that and let me know what you see!

i am still getting error loading data when using public url for the interface

11:58 AM
What's the public URL you're using?

Also, are you hosting it somewhere (like GitHub Pages) or just opening the HTML file locally?

If you can share the URL or a screenshot of the error, I can help troubleshoot. The API calls work fine (we just tested them), so it might be a hosting/CORS issue.

https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/bfa5569a-3748-4a62-9141-35b67493b2cc

11:58 AM
Ah, that's the problem! Claude's public artifact URLs block external API requests for security reasons.

You need to host the HTML file elsewhere. Two easy options:

Option 1: GitHub Pages (free, takes 5 min)

Go to github.com and sign in (or create account)
Click + → New repository
Name it squares-for-ms
Make it Public
Click Create repository
Click "uploading an existing file"
Upload your squares-for-ms.html file
Rename it to index.html after uploading
Go to Settings → Pages
Under "Source", select main branch → Save
Your URL will be: https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/squares-for-ms/
Option 2: Netlify Drop (even faster)

Go to app.netlify.com/drop
Rename your file to index.html
Drag and drop it onto the page
Done — you get a public URL instantly
Want me to walk you through either option?

incredible so technically i can do a few test runs then all i have to do to reset it is clear all the data from the spreadsheets correct

1:21 PM
Exactly! To reset everything, just clear the data rows in your Google Sheet:

Squares tab — delete rows 2 and below (keep the header row)

Pending tab — delete rows 2 and below (keep the header row)

Form Responses 1 tab — delete rows 2 and below (keep the header row)

Settings tab — keep as is (just leave the Value column empty for RowNumbers, ColNumbers, FinalScore)

That's it — fresh start, ready to go again. The webpage will automatically show an empty grid.

Go ahead and test it out! Try:

Selecting some squares and submitting
Check if it shows up in Form Responses
Manually add someone to the Squares tab and see if the grid updates

form responses are only recording to the first tab (which was automatically created when i linked the form to spreadsheet).

That's perfect — that's exactly how it should work!

Form Responses 1 = where new requests come in automatically

Your workflow:

Someone submits on the website → shows up in Form Responses 1 (like Kiera requesting square 0-7)
You check Venmo for payment
Once paid, you manually add them to the Squares tab:
Row: 0
Col: 7
Name: Kiera
The grid updates automatically (within 30 seconds)
So Form Responses is just your inbox — you move confirmed people to the Squares tab after they pay.

Want me to simplify this so you don't have to manually copy data? I could add a "Pending" view that reads directly from Form Responses instead.

yeah its not showing pending squares on the site after they have been requested

That's because the website reads from the Pending tab, not from Form Responses 1.

You have two options:

Option A: Manually copy to Pending tab (current setup)

When someone submits:

See it in Form Responses 1
Copy to Pending tab (Row: 0, Col: 7, Name: Kiera)
Square shows yellow on grid
After Venmo payment, move them to Squares tab
Square shows gray (confirmed)
Option B: I update the code to read from Form Responses 1 directly

This way:

Form submission → automatically shows as pending (yellow)
You just move to Squares tab after payment
No manual "Pending" step
Want me to update the code for Option B? It's simpler for you.

option b

Update the code to read pending from Form Responses 1 instead of Pending tab

Done! Now the flow is simpler:

New workflow:

Someone submits → automatically shows yellow (pending) on the grid
You check Venmo for payment
Once paid, add them to the Squares tab → turns gray (confirmed)
Delete their row from Form Responses 1 (optional, keeps it clean)
You can delete the Pending tab if you want — it's no longer used.
